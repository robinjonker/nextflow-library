## This is the final report for the project relating to creating a nextflow library for scientific workflows. The actual library with its testing and documentation can be found in the linked website.

### Abstract: 

The creation and testing of a location-aware scientific workflows library is presented. This library automatically sets the
execution location of processes based on the locality of the principal data required. The library is created and tested on the Wits
Core Research Cluster, an HPC environment. The library is successfully tested using existing workflows in Nextflow DSL 2 on the
Wits Core Research Cluster. The library reduces execution times by more than 50% under all conditions. Repeating the same
workflow version 15 times, it was found that the standard deviation of execution times is lowered by more than 85%. Testing also
shows as the number of input files increases, the dynamic location-aware library’s performance increases in comparison. The library’s
testing data is validated with a second workflow. The library along with various aspects such as development documentation and
the different workflow versions can be found on the GitHub repository here.

### Project Result

I am proud to have achieved 84% for the project.
